# ASCII bigram frequency order v1

`ascii-bigram-frequency-order-v1.bin` is the canonical v1 frequency table. Its 26,500 unique little-endian `u16` values are byte-pair IDs ordered from most common to least common; its reviewed SHA-256 is `97c07c74fb0947242a253597db342e1e3e0734dc3a7dde351a0a56fb53686919`.

`ngram.rs` expands the ordered IDs into one rank for every possible byte pair at compile time. Learned ranks apply only when both bytes are ASCII; other byte pairs use their deterministic pair ID as the weight. The raw v1 table digest is embedded in every persisted index header, so changing the table makes existing indexes ineligible and requires a rebuild.

Each later table is a new versioned file. Updating the active version requires changing the `include_bytes!` path, reviewed digest test, Bazel data entry, this document, and performance benchmark results in the same change.
