# TypeScript Testing Guidelines

Read `testing.instructions.md` first. This file adds TypeScript-specific commands and test conventions.

## Validation

- Run the smallest owning `typecheck:*`, `test:*`, or `build:*` script that covers the changed source. A unit test pass does not replace the affected TypeScript compilation or production build.
- Use repository package scripts through `corepack pnpm`; do not invent a parallel compiler or test entrypoint when an owning script exists.
- For web, Electron UI, and Electron end-to-end behavior, use the repository Playwright projects. Diagnose failures from state, logs, traces, and DOM evidence rather than treating screenshots as the test oracle.
- When the full test compilation is blocked by an unrelated failure, compile and run the affected test directly using the same compiler options and report both results. Do not describe the full suite as passing.

## Test code

- Name tests in behavior language and keep arrange, act, and assert easy to identify.
- Prefer comparing a complete result over many disconnected field assertions when the full value is the behavior.
- Do not export production helpers solely for tests.
- Prefer state, events, DOM semantics, accessibility, and geometry over screenshots.
- Register and dispose real listeners, timers, transports, models, and other owned resources through the same lifecycle used by production code.

## Generated contracts

- Generated transport DTOs and decoders are not frontend-owned types. Change the backend protocol owner, regenerate the artifacts, then run a strict generated-contract compile and the affected frontend typecheck.
- Frontend tests import generated contracts through their supported entrypoints; they do not preserve deleted generated files or deep paths as compatibility shims.
