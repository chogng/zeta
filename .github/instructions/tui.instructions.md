# Zeta Code CLI/TUI Guidelines

Follow [`docs/tui.md`](../../docs/tui.md) for the product architecture, state ownership, event flow, current implementation, migration sequence, and validation requirements.

`zeta-code` owns `zeta-cli`, `zeta-tui`, raw-mode lifecycle, Ratatui interaction, and CLI product composition. Do not move this product presentation or lifecycle into `zeta-rs`; shared backend semantics must first form a backend-neutral contract with a real non-TUI consumer.

Keep one writer for each product state, render from explicit state, isolate side effects, reject stale asynchronous results by request/revision identity, and keep host adapters narrow. Feature behavior belongs in vertical feature owners rather than a global application switch.

Prefer command-line-observable tests for state, events, terminal output, timing, and lifecycle. Do not use screenshots or terminal pixel baselines as the primary pass/fail signal.
