# Third-party notices

Zeta Desktop directly distributes the following third-party components.
Release packaging must include this file and the referenced license and notice
texts.

The component-owned paths above are the canonical repository sources. Release packaging must copy their contents into the application license staging directory alongside this notice instead of maintaining duplicate source-controlled copies.

Transitive dependencies and third-party material distributed by Electron or
native runtimes remain governed by their own accompanying notices. Before a
release, the packaging pipeline must retain those upstream notices and verify
that this direct-dependency list still matches `zeta-ts/package.json` and the
Rust components linked into the shipped `zeta` executable.
