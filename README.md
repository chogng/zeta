# Ash

Ash is a Rust-first agent workspace with three product lines sharing one App Server contract:

| Product | Description | Source | Start |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ash code` | CLI and TUI | [`ash-code`](ash-code) | `just ash` |
| `ash` | Electron Desktop | [`ash-ts`](ash-ts) | `just ash-desktop` |
| `app` | Native Rust Desktop terminal | [`app`](app) | `just app` |

`ash-rs` contains the shared Rust backend. The product-neutral backend executable is
`ash-app-server`, owned by [`ash-app-server`](ash-rs/app-server/README.md). Electron's `code` and
`academic` builds are internal variants, not additional product lines; see
[`docs/product-lines.md`](docs/product-lines.md) and [`docs/workbench-modes.md`](docs/workbench-modes.md).

## Quick start

On Windows, initialize the Rust development environment with the repository setup script. It installs the toolchain declared by `rust-toolchain.toml` together with MSVC, the Windows SDK, Git, ripgrep, just, CMake, LLVM, Python 3.12, and cargo-insta:

~~~powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/ash-rs/setup-windows.ps1
~~~

On macOS or Linux, install Rust. Cargo supplies the input classifier's
build-time Protocol Buffers compiler; no system `protoc` installation is
required.

For Electron or Browser Workbench development, install the pinned pnpm workspace:

```bash
corepack pnpm install
```

Build definitions live in [`build/`](build), while reproducible local artifacts are collected under the ignored `.build/` root. See [`docs/build.md`](docs/build.md) for the command and output layout.

Build all three product lines through the repository-level command:

```bash
just build
```

`corepack pnpm build` builds only the Electron and Browser workspace.

### `ash code`

```bash
just ash
just ash ask "explain this repository"
just ash exec "summarize the current changes"
```

Without `just`:

```bash
cargo run -p ash-cli --bin ash
```

### `ash` Electron Desktop

```bash
just ash-desktop
# or:
corepack pnpm dev:desktop
```

The Desktop command is shared by both Workbench build modes. The default mode is `code`; build
matrix checks can set `ASH_WORKBENCH_MODE=academic` without changing the command name.

### Browser Workbench

```bash
corepack pnpm dev:web       # disconnected UI at http://127.0.0.1:5173/
corepack pnpm dev:web:full # Rust-backed UI at http://127.0.0.1:5174/
```

The full Web mode is a local development integration, not a deployable Web service.

### Stanza standalone editor

只调试 Stanza 编辑器本身时运行：

```bash
corepack pnpm dev:stanza
```

然后打开 `http://127.0.0.1:5199/build/vite/stanza/index.html`。在 VS Code 中也可以直接选择
`Stanza Editor - Standalone` 配置按 F5；它会自动启动同一个 Vite 任务。页面把完整 API 暴露为
`globalThis.stanza`，可在浏览器控制台检查 `stanza.editor.getEditors()` 和
`stanza.editor.getModels()`。

### `app`

```bash
just app
# or:
python3 -B scripts/cargo.py run -p app
```

## Repository map

- [`ash-rs`](ash-rs): shared protocol, App Server, domain, storage, execution, and runtime crates.
- [`ash-code`](ash-code): CLI command host and TUI presentation.
- [`ash-ts`](ash-ts): Electron Main, Preload, Renderer, and Browser Workbench.
- [`build`](build): checked-in build orchestration; generated artifacts go to `.build/`.
- [`app`](app): native window, terminal, renderer, and product UI.
- [`docs`](docs): architecture and system documentation; start with [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).
